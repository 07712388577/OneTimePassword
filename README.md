The OneTimePassword library is the core of [Authenticator](http://mattrubin.me/authenticator/). It can generate both [time-based](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238) and [counter-based](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4226) one-time passwords as standardized in RFC 4226 and 6238. It can also read and generate the ["otpauth://" URLs](https://code.google.com/p/google-authenticator/wiki/KeyUriFormat) commonly used to set up OTP tokens, and can save and load tokens to and from the iOS secure keychain.
